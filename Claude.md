# SearchEngine PoC - Project Analysis test

## Project Overview
This is a **Proof of Concept (PoC) Search Engine** for IT-Architecture semester 6 at Erhvervsakademiet Aarhus. The system is designed as an internal document search solution for organizations with 50+ employees.

**Important Note**: This is a school project with restrictions on file modifications and creation. Not all files may be editable, and the simplicity is intentional for educational purposes.

## Architecture & Components

### Solution Structure
- **`indexer`** - Console application that crawls and indexes documents
- **`ConsoleSearch`** - Console application providing search functionality  
- **`Shared`** - Class library containing common models and configuration

### Technology Stack
- **.NET 9.0** C# console applications
- **SQLite database** for inverted index storage
- **Microsoft.Data.Sqlite** NuGet package (version 8.0.1)

### Database Schema (Inverted Index)
```sql
Document: docId, title, link, date
Word: termId, value  
Occurrence: docId, termId (many-to-many relationship)
```

## Core Components Analysis

### 1. Indexer (`indexer` project)
**Entry Point**: `Program.cs` ‚Üí `App.cs`
- **Configuration**: `Config.cs` - defines folder to index
- **Crawler**: `Crawler.cs` - main indexing logic
- **Database**: `DatabaseSqlite.cs` - handles database operations

**Current Configuration**:
```csharp
// Config.cs
public static string FOLDER = @"/Users/oleeriksen/Data/seData/medium";

// Paths.cs (Shared)
public static string DATABASE = @"/Users/oleeriksen/Data/searchDBmedium.db";
```

**Indexing Process**:
1. Recursively crawls specified directory for `.txt` files only
2. Extracts words using separators: `" \\\n\t\"$'!,?;.:-_**+=)([]{}<>/@&%‚Ç¨#"`
3. Creates inverted index mapping words ‚Üí documents containing them
4. Outputs statistics: document count, unique words, first 10 words

### 2. Search Engine (`ConsoleSearch` project)
**Entry Point**: `Program.cs` ‚Üí `App.cs`
- **Search Logic**: `SearchLogic.cs` - implements search algorithm
- **Database**: `DatabaseSqlite.cs` - read-only database access
- **Models**: `SearchResult.cs`, `DocumentHit.cs`

**Search Process**:
1. Accepts multi-word queries via console input
2. Converts words to word IDs
3. Finds documents containing those words
4. Ranks by score (descending), limits to top 10
5. Shows: document path, matching terms count, missing terms, timestamp

**Scoring Algorithm**: 
```
score = (number_of_matching_terms / total_query_terms)
```

### 3. Shared Library (`Shared` project)
- **`BEDocument.cs`**: Document model (mId, mUrl, mIdxTime, mCreationTime)
- **`Paths.cs`**: Database path configuration
- **`IDatabase.cs`**: Database interface definition

## Test Data Structure

### Enron Email Dataset
Located in: `C:\Users\Gusta\OneDrive\Dokumenter\GitHub\SearchEngine-main\Data\seData copy\`

**Three Dataset Sizes**:
- **small**: 13 emails in 1 folder (functional testing)
- **medium**: ~5,000 emails in ~20 mailboxes (functional + performance)
- **large**: ~50,000 emails for 15 users (performance testing)

**Data Format**: Email files with headers and content
```
Message-ID: <...>
Date: Wed, 13 Dec 2000 18:41:00 -0800 (PST)
From: sender@domain.com
To: recipient@domain.com
Subject: Email Subject
...email content...
```

## Requirements (from Danish Documentation)

### Business Context
- Organization with 50+ employees producing documents
- Documents in multiple formats (docx, pdf, rtf, txt, csv, pptx, xlsx)
- Multi-terabyte collections across file servers
- Need for "instant content search"
- Domain-specific customization capability

### Technical Requirements
- **100% recall**: All documents containing any search terms must appear
- **Ranking**: Results ordered by descending score
- **Scoring**: Percentage of query terms found in document (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Future features**: Synonym dictionary for domain-specific terms

### User Interface Requirements
- Google-like search interface
- Results showing: title, link, date, score, snippet
- Can be web application (intranet) or desktop application

## Current Configuration Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **Paths need updating for Windows environment**:
- Database path: Currently `/Users/oleeriksen/Data/searchDBmedium.db`
- Index folder: Currently `/Users/oleeriksen/Data/seData/medium`

## Available Assignments (from Danish docs)

### Assignment 1: Setup
- Install .NET 9.0
- Install SQLite browser
- Build all projects, update NuGet packages
- Update paths in `Shared.Paths` and `Indexer.Config`
- Run indexer, inspect database
- Test search console with 1, 2, and multiple word queries

### Assignment 2: Enhanced Statistics
- Modify indexer output to show:
  - Total word occurrences indexed
  - User-specified number of most frequent words
  - Words ranked by frequency (most frequent first)

### Assignment 3: Case Sensitivity Control
- Add user commands like `/casesensitive=on/off`
- Alternative: Add `CaseSensitive` boolean to Config class

### Assignment 4: Timestamp Display Control
- Add user commands like `/timestamp=on/off`
- Alternative: Add `ViewTimeStamps` boolean to Config class

### Assignment 5: Result Limit Configuration
- Change from fixed 10 results to user-configurable
- Add commands like `/results=15` or `/results=all`
- Alternative: Add `int?` result limit to Config class

### Assignment 6: Pattern Matching (Advanced)
- Implement wildcard search with `?` (single char) and `*` (multiple chars)
- Example: `BJ????7` matches 7-char words starting with BJ, ending with 7
- Show matching terms in results

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- Basic indexing and search functionality
- Clean three-project architecture
- Realistic test data (Enron dataset)
- Proper inverted index implementation
- Score-based ranking

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Work
- Path configuration for Windows environment
- No snippets in search results yet
- No synonym dictionary support
- No case sensitivity control
- Fixed 10-result limit
- No wildcard/pattern search

### üö´ School Project Constraints
- Limited ability to edit certain files
- Cannot create arbitrary new files
- Simplicity is intentional for educational purposes
- Focus on extending existing functionality vs. major architectural changes

## Assignment Progress Tracking

**üìã See `assignments.md` for detailed progress tracking in Danish**

The `assignments.md` file contains:
- All 6 assignments from the Danish documentation
- Current status and progress for each assignment
